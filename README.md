Hello Bonnie C.,
    My name is James Chapman, I work at company X under the project manager. I know you typically make contact with company X through the project manager, however he is currently out of town. I need a few things in order to finish your marketing site project. If you could send us a picture of the project and a few paragraphs for the "About Us" section of the page we can imput those and finish the site by the deadline. I also CCed the project manager inorder for him to stay upto date with the project. If you have any questions about what kind of information we need, just reply to this email and I will guide you from there.
Thank you for you help,
James Chapman
